# 一、 traditionn in a modern world
## 1. hook: 举例子，抛出问题
#### “When you look at China today, what do you see first? The skyscrapers in Shanghai, or the ancient temples that have stood for centuries? The truth is, both are part of who we are.下面是简单的小例子. That moment made me realize: tradition never disappears; it simply transforms.”

## 2. points: 想出3层观点
### A. Tradition is not disappearing, it is transforming.这一句不能写出来，但是要知道是干嘛
#### Festivals like the Spring Festival or the Dragon Boat Festival are still celebrated, but now we buy gifts online and send blessings through mobile apps. Ancient poetry is shared on social media, and even Peking Opera can reach new audiences through AI technology. Tradition is not fading—it is adapting.
### B. Tradition provides identity in a fast-changing world.
#### In a time of rapid economic growth and globalization, tradition serves as our root. Young people wear Hanfu, embrace “guochao” fashion, and rediscover Confucian values. These traditions remind us of where we come from, and give us a sense of belonging in a world of constant change.
### C. Tradition and modernity are not enemies, but partners.
#### Technology gives new life to tradition. Projects like Digital Dunhuang preserve ancient murals and make them accessible worldwide. Traditional wisdom also inspires modern life—for example, the idea of balance in Chinese medicine helps us think about sustainable development today.

## 3. closing: 总结或者升华主题
#### Tradition in a modern world is not about living in the past. It is about carrying the past into the future, giving us roots while we keep growing. If modernity is the wind that pushes us forward, tradition is the anchor that keeps us grounded.

# 二、Technology: A Window to Understanding Contemporary China

## Point
#### Ladies and gentlemen,
#### When we try to understand contemporary China, technology offers us one of the clearest windows. It not only reflects China’s rapid development, but also reveals the values, ambitions, and everyday lives of the Chinese people.

## Reason
#### Why is technology such a powerful window? Because in today’s China, technology is not just a tool—it is a driving force that reshapes industries, empowers ordinary citizens, and connects China with the wider world. From artificial intelligence to green energy, every breakthrough tells us something about the nation’s priorities and dreams.

## Example
#### Take China’s space program as an example. The Tiangong space station is more than a scientific project; it is a symbol of national confidence and global collaboration. Or consider digital technology: mobile payments, smart cities, and AI-powered healthcare have transformed the way people live, especially in rural areas where access to resources used to be limited. These stories show how technology is deeply woven into the fabric of society, bridging gaps and inspiring hope.

## Point (Restatement)
#### So, to understand contemporary China, we cannot ignore technology. It is a lens that shows us not only how fast the country is moving, but also where it is heading. Technology tells the story of a nation determined to innovate, to share, and to contribute to the world. And through this window, we can see a China that is modern, dynamic, and ready for the future.

#### Thank you.
